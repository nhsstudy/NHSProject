<h2>Covid-19 Nursing Home Project</h2>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Faculty at Appalachian State University have teamed up to discover new insights with regards to the Coronavirusâ€™s impact in Nursing Homes. The group that has taken on this project is composed of individuals with a variety of specialities such as information systems, health care management, prior experience in  nursing home administration, public health and health disparities, health care industry processes, emerging  technologies, social inclusion, at-risk populations and health outcomes. Their research at present focuses on highlighting the different nursing home characteristics that further the spread of COVID-19 and external factors such as socioeconomics,demographics, and region. 

<br>
    This COVID-19 impact analysis will investigate the effects of the virus in Nursing homes across the United States and how aspects such as demographics, staffing, supplies, etc. contribute towards its spread. As the virus continues to spread and mutate to the point of evading some of the popular vaccines on the market, it is crucial for the development of products that will allow nursing home officials and staff to have the ability to make smarter decisions which will reduce the spread of the virus in the work environment. These products can also potentially save the lives of nursing home residents and staff as well as encourage the creation of new policies that alleviate other issues that arise on part of the coronavirus. The products will be presented in the form of dashboards which give the nursing home stakeholders such as CMS officials, nursing home administrators and staff the ability to visualize and observe the magnitude of the role of coronavirus within their respective facility.

<h2>Project Scope</h2>

<p>The purpose of the project is to develop a dashboard to answer questions developed by the research team in hopes of furthering understanding of the COVID-19 situation within nursing homes and allowing Stakeholders to make informed decisions which can but is not limited to reducing the spread of the coronavirus. The viability of the dashboard will depend on the attributes possessed such as the type of information conveyed, the level of detail, and reusability potential. The success of stakeholders after acting based on the information provided from the dashboard can inspire new policies to be developed for the sake of implementation in nursing home facilities across the country which will ultimately improve their situations in light of the pandemic.</p>

<h2>About the Data</h2>

<p>The data comes primarily from the Center of Medicare and Medicaid data collection on Nursing Homes across the United States.The dataset used is being updated weekly and contains 279 variables which correspond to over 15,000 nursing homes that decided to report information. This dataset  was already cleaned, prepared and contained time-series data related to cumulative coronavirus cases, deaths and  new cases.  There will be supplemental data being used such as the sets regarding United States confirmed cases, deaths, and county populations.</p>
