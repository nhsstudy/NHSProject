<h1>Covid-19 Nursing Home Project</h1>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Faculty at Appalachian State University have teamed up to discover new insights with regards to the Coronavirus’s impact in Nursing Homes. The group that has taken on this project is composed of individuals with a variety of specialities such as information systems, health care management, prior experience in  nursing home administration, public health and health disparities, health care industry processes, emerging  technologies, social inclusion, at-risk populations and health outcomes. Their research at present focuses on highlighting the different nursing home characteristics that further the spread of COVID-19 and external factors such as socioeconomics,demographics, and region. 

<br>
    This COVID-19 impact analysis will investigate the effects of the virus in Nursing homes across the United States and how aspects such as demographics, staffing, supplies, etc. contribute towards its spread. As the virus continues to spread and mutate to the point of evading some of the popular vaccines on the market, it is crucial for the development of products that will allow nursing home officials and staff to have the ability to make smarter decisions which will reduce the spread of the virus in the work environment. These products can also potentially save the lives of nursing home residents and staff as well as encourage the creation of new policies that alleviate other issues that arise on part of the coronavirus. The products will be presented in the form of dashboards which give the nursing home stakeholders such as CMS officials, nursing home administrators and staff the ability to visualize and observe the magnitude of the role of coronavirus within their respective facility. 
</p>

<h2>Project Scope</h2>

<p>The purpose of the project is to develop a dashboard to answer questions developed by the research team in hopes of furthering understanding of the COVID-19 situation within nursing homes and allowing Stakeholders to make informed decisions which can but is not limited to reducing the spread of the coronavirus. The viability of the dashboard will depend on the attributes possessed such as the type of information conveyed, the level of detail, and reusability potential. The success of stakeholders after acting based on the information provided from the dashboard can inspire new policies to be developed for the sake of implementation in nursing home facilities across the country which will ultimately improve their situations in light of the pandemic.</p>

<h2>About the Data</h2>

<p>There are two sources of data that are being interacted with for the purposes of this project. The first source is the center of medicare and medicaid services (CMS) which provides a large dataset corresponding to over 15,000 nursing homes that decided to report information. CMS also provides an archive with rehabilitation information which contains details such as quality ratings, health/fire inspection ratings, etc. Second are the data from USAFacts which contains daily cases/deaths information by US county as well as population info. For further information about the data from these sources, please consider clicking on the links below to view their websites.</p>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<br>
<ul>
    <p>This visualization is meant to capture Resident issues over a period of 62 weeks. Issues include admissions, cases, and deaths. Furthermore, county statistics such as total
        cases and population are captured so that the nursing homes can be compared to the status of the county. 
    </p>
<li><a href="https://nhsstudy.github.io/NHSProject/UserStory1.html">Shift in Resident Issues over Time</a></li>
<p>This visualization is meant to show the top nursing homes experiencing problems within a certain category as of the most recent date. Issues include 
    resident/staff admissions,cases,deaths, etc.
</p>
<li><a href="https://nhsstudy.github.io/NHSProject/UserStory3.html">Top Nursing Homes Experiencing Issues</a></li>
<p>
    This visualization is meant to display staff and resident issues in comparision to staff shortages and personal protective equipment availability.
</p>
<li><a href="https://nhsstudy.github.io/NHSProject/UserStory4.html">Timeline of Resident and Staff Issues with Safety Indicators</a></li>
<p>
    This visualization is meant to view the changes in total resident cases over the 62 week period and compare the nursing homes 2020 and 2021 performance side by side.
